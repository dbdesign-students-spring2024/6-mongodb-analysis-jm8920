Things We love include....

Traveling -- whether it’s  local or international travel, we love learning customs, cuisines, and meeting local  people.  It enriches the experience of traveling. This is primarily why we chose airbnb as the conduit to rent.  When you live amongst locals, the experience of traveling becomes more intimate and personal. 

Eating -- We love a good meal from any venue -- it could be a sit down restaurant or a food truck/street vendor. A nice glass of wine or a good cocktail wouldn't hurt either.

There are two of us who live here-- myself, Laura (as pictured) and my boyfriend/bandmate Anton, who is a violinist, producer and arranger. We really love our home and suppose we would best describe its aesthetic as Bavarian or French rustic country farm house/cottage. Also highly inspired by the illustrations on the Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea box (the ones with the bears in a very cozy and sweet-looking cottage-y home). Staying here does very much feel like a fairy tale. Ideally we would like to have whoever else stays here respect the dear and  precious (to us) objects in our home and appreciate it's warm and whimsical atmosphere.

My love of baking began when I was just 4 years old and spent much of my time at my mother's side while she worked in The Vienna Bakery of Tempe, AZ.  Little did I know I would move from art and dance to baking as my life's work. 

Along with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.  My musical taste is all over the map. From straight up jazz to 60's and 70's rock to music from all over the world.

I have one daughter who has given me three super charged grandchildren, whom I just adore!  You may meet them during your stay with me.

I look forward to meeting all of you who choose to visit my home.  You will find it to be very comfortable and peaceful.  Some guests have even described it as ""magical.""

My love of baking began when I was just 4 years old and spent much of my time at my mother's side while she worked in The Vienna Bakery of Tempe, AZ.  Little did I know I would move from art and dance to baking as my life's work. 

Along with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.  My musical taste is all over the map. From straight up jazz to 60's and 70's rock to music from all over the world.

I have one daughter who has given me three super charged grandchildren, whom I just adore!  You may meet them during your stay with me.

I look forward to meeting all of you who choose to visit my home.  You will find it to be very comfortable and peaceful.  Some guests have even described it as ""magical.""

I moved back to the Bay Area in 2013 after living in LA for 4 years. I did my undergrad at Stanford, got my MBA at UCLA and have worked in interior design, product design, graphic and web design. 

I love to hike, throw a football, and watch the sun set. I garden on sunny days and cook when I'm inspired.

You will usually see me with a tool in my hand. I like construction and DIY projects. I built a fence recently and fix things around the house. I really like to clean. 

My wonderful girlfriend, Cathy, lives in Berkeley and my (large) family lives in San Francisco. I have a house in Oakland. I split my time between San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland and cross the bridge almost everyday.

I love meeting people and sharing my home, and that is why I host. As a host, I want to make sure that you have everything you need to start your day right and that you have a pleasant home to return to. You'll have plenty of freedom to explore the City on your own. I'm pretty hands-off after the first day, but I'm always near my cell phone if you need help, unless I'm camping or on vacation.

As a guest, I'm quiet, independent. I like to start my day early and sleep around 11 PM. I prefer nature to cities, I like to read books, I love coffee, I travel with my girlfriend who likes the same things. 

My motto? I count my blessings.

Lucia is from Grove City, Western Pennsylvania; a small town about 60 miles from Pittsburgh.  She moved to CA in 1982 after 15 years as an inner city elementary school teacher in Columbus, OH. 
 
With her  background in education, since moving to CA she held various positions in training in a business environment and since 1988 worked in educational publishing sales.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

About Lauren: I enjoy our 1913 Edwardian home here in Oakland. I love working with my hands, always making something or fixing something else.  So, you could see me futzing around the place with tools or a brush. I enjoy hiking in our beautiful East Bay regional parks (and beyond.) And, baby – I can cook!! You might easily find me in the kitchen rockin’ to indie folk music (or Golden Age musicals and Big Band) and making a batch of New Mexican posole! I love good beer and fine wine and spending time with Dolores laughing our butts off. I also enjoy the peace and solitude of our lovely little garden and you can find me and Dolores having coffee on the deck in the morning sun.  Professionally, I'm the Artists' Services Manager of the Merola Opera Program, contracted with San Francisco Opera.

About Dolores: I received my PhD in Film Studies at UC Berkeley and currently teach online. My area of focus is ""divas"" (for real!), and enjoy a good cocktail, good conversation, and all the films of Catherine Deneuve.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

We have truly enjoyed creating a space that is welcoming and comfortable for our guests. We love hosting on Airbnb and have had some wonderful experiences as Airbnb guests - most recently during trips to Tulum, Montreal, Spain & Morocco. 

Our guest suite is a private, indoor-outdoor space that is separated from the main house by a deck.  We simplified the guest spaces to make it possible to follow cleaning and sanitizing best practices during this time. The spaces are now more minimal but still feel cozy. 

We were students at UC Berkley and lived in San Francisco (and got married & had a baby) before moving to this special spot. We appreciate the wonderful diversity of people, food, art & nature found in Oakland and having been in the Bay Area for many years, we know it well.  We are more than happy to make recommendations for local restaurants, bookstores, shops, classes, hiking trails...looking for something else? We could probably make a recommendation for that too. :)

We are available if anything comes up and the separation between the main house and cottage provides our guests with space and privacy.

I’m a Bay Area Native (grew up in Palo Alto, lived in San Francisco) and have been 'on the sunny side of the bay' for the past 16 years. I have to say -- it's the best! I find that it provides the perfect combination of natural beauty (hiking and biking in nearby redwood forests), warm/sunny weather, bike and walk-friendly boulevards, historic homes, and easy access to diverse restaurants, urban sites/interests in downtown Berkeley (blocks away) and nearby Oakland and San Francisco.

I'm a long-time fan of Airbnb having hosted lovely guests in my former Glenview bungalow (I hope the reviews still show up!) and staying with awesome hosts while traveling. This is the first time hosting our new Berkeley home. We're excited to meet you and make your stay here a perfect one!

And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also.

- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up.

My own travel is often trekking, stopping at guest houses, or traveling by bus, whether in Bulgaria or China.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

It's kind of considered a part of  ""NOBE"" (North Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville). Since the pandemic, Oakland and much of the Bay Area has had a rise in homelessness and transients. The neighborhood is comprised of diverse working class families and people from all walks of life. The surrounding neighborhood is emerging and urban so we'd only recommend you book if you're comfortable in a big city/urban environment. We have many neighbors, some you'll never see and others that hang out in front of their homes. They're all nice so a little smile and hi go a long way. You'll encounter all sorts of things on the street; hipsters, yupsters, regular Joe's, homeless people, and trash/debris. In other words having STREET SMARTS and being comfortable with diversity are highly recommended. We're often asked about bsafety when booking or staying in Oakland, and it's not really a question we can answer for you since it's highly subjective.

Little did I know I would move from art and dance to baking as my life's work. 

Along with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.  My musical taste is all over the map. From straight up jazz to 60's and 70's rock to music from all over the world.

In a macadamia nutshell, our dream became a reality when we purchased our Hawaii home in 2015. This could not be possible if it wasn’t for God’s goodness all the time in our life. Therefore, to share in our lifelong dream, we invite you to come and enjoy your stay in our “Laule’a Ohana Hale” (peaceful family home) on the Big Island of Hawaii. Also, if you happen to need a place to stay in the East Bay (Northern Cali), we got a cozy studio, “Piedmont Pines Cottage” for you.

 My name is Omar and I'm originally from San Francisco.  In addition to my hometown, I've lived in:  Los Angeles, San Diego, Indianapolis, Pensacola, Newport RI, Iceland (yes Iceland), and now Oakland.  

One of my greatest passions is traveling.  I love visiting new cities and countries. 
 Learning new languages and meeting new people.  And as a former Naval Officer, I've had the opportunity to live and travel to several countries.  Including traversing much of our world's oceans and almost all of the 50 US states and it's territories.  

Some of the countries  I've been to include:  Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Iceland, Oman, England, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Brazil, etc.

 So as a frequent traveler I know exactly what's important when staying away from home.  Therefore, as a host, my mission is to facilitate you with a beautiful, clean, comfortable ""home away from home"" as well as offer you the best service, so that you enjoy your stay to the fullest.  
 
You'll love my neighborhood's central location, variety of places to eat and year round warm weather.  My mission is to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  So please reach out to me if you have any questions. 

I'm looking forward to welcoming you!

I'm not one for talking about myself BUT I guess this would be a pretty valid excuse. :-)
In regards to being a guest in someone's home let me start off by saying that i am always respectful of other people and their belongings. As a guest in your home I would respectfully treat your space as I would my own (That's a good thing - I promise). I am appreciative of the opportunity to stay in someone's home and to see foreign cities from a local perspective. I'm a non smoker but I don't mind being in the company of people who smoke. 

A little more about me...
I've taken a few trips across the western hemisphere... visiting Toronto, Belize, Jamaica, Mexico, and Costa Rica. I haven't done much traveling in the past three years because I have 2 year old twins, enough said. :-)
Places I'd like to visit.. Spain, Morocco, Italy, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to name a few.
My idea of a good time while on vacation would be hanging out with locals or fellow travelers at a bar or cafe. I truly feel that life is about the relationships that you build along the way. 

In a nutshell I'm a product of my environment, a cool, laid-back, California kid from the San Francisco Bay Area.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up.

I am an adjunct professor of composition, literature and critical thinking in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In addition to teaching work at the university/college level, I greatly enjoy experiences of the natural and social worlds, including arts, culture, and nature.  I am a writer and engage with other creative activities, though my interests are broad.

As a traveler, I typically look to have experiences outside of a typical tourist frame of mind, and enjoy immersive experiences of place that are natural and uncontrived, though good museums are always appreciated.

As a guest, I am generally easy-going and open-natured, though I do like a bit of privacy during my stays, I am open to conversations and good relations with you.  Positive vibes all around.

In addition, some things I like include:

Night ocean swimming

Research, writing, creative work

Cinema

Exploring spaces

Gatherings and outings with friends

Very pleased to meet you!

I grew up in Boston, MA and graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor Degree’s in Finance. After graduation, I moved to the Seattle area for a year but decided to settle in Oakland in 1992, where I raised my two sons, who are now adults.
I enjoy dancing, checking out real estate, skiing, traveling, wine tasting, and listening to live music, or simply cooking for my family and friends. Why cooking? I enjoy hosting a small party because I enjoy setting a pretty table, playing with the lighting and music, stocking the bathroom with cute items, and making my cocktail and dinner menus. These are all a sort of an artistic exercise that I find very satisfying. It’s a lot of work but it’s just very nice to see everyone dolled up and happy. At the end of the party, I feel I’ve contributed my gift to everyone, especially to my family and friends. I consider myself a great cook and a great bartender. One of things I enjoy most to make is seafood; I also love to mix cocktails with fresh herbs before dinner and then serve red wine at dinner. I know seafood is not supposed to pair with red wine but I like drinking red wine with anything. Who wouldn’t like it, right?
Since I am an empty nester and a world traveler, I have always been looking for new places to travel and eat. When I travel whether domestically and internationally or whether staying in a hotel or an Airbnb, I do pay a lot attention to cleanliness and comfort, amenities, and the location of the stay. My utmost priority is a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I don’t smoke. I am very tidy, clean, and respectful with my surroundings.

I am usually traveling with my husband, Matt.

In the last 20 years we have lived in Minneapolis, Bogota, Lima, Arequipa, NYC, San Francisco, and now call Oakland home. I work in global education and have traveled to more than 30 countries.

My family and I have used AirBnB all over the US and internationally, and are especially fond of treehouses, yurts and other interesting dwellings. We are respectful, clean and like cozy, well-designed spaces -- in fact our previous SF apartment was featured in Apartment Therapy (design publication).

Our top favorite cities to visit (to date) include Bologna, Montreal, Hanoi, Madrid, Bogotá, and Istanbul. We love perfecting our espresso technique, exploring new cities, and listening to music on our growing record collection. 

We speak Spanish, Italian (though rusty!),  and some Portuguese (just Matt).

We have upped our cleaning game to ensure a covid-safe environment. Our little cottage has a shower, Nespresso maker, microwave, small refrigerator, sink, heat and fun treats for those late night cravings.

Mark is a spiritual teacher merging fitness into presence. Shelley works as a demographer.  We both love biking, cooking, gardening, the wine country and loving life together.

But the prettiest art may be the Art Deco buildings themselves, with the crown jewels being the show stopping Fox and the Paramount theaters. The former is mostly a live music venue; the latter channels its inner flapper often (classic movies with a live organ player). Art galleries, run by the artists or by volunteers, are opening in brick warehouses. Down side streets are scenes of the start-up, DIY revolution with co-ops, an urban winery, entrepreneur hubs, and creative centers.<br /><br />The house is conveniently located close to downtown Oakland.

I'll be your host during your stay. :) I live next door to my airbnb listing,  so I'm there to help if you need anything. 

What am I like as a host?

I am a planner. I like to prepare ahead of time to ensure you have a great experience arriving at my home, during your stay, and when you head home. 

Go ahead. Cook a good meal, take a shower, sleep in and get your beauty rest! You'll find you have everything you need to be nice &  comfy while you're staying with me. I aim to be responsive and provide anything you might need to make your stay enjoyable. If you need anything at all,  just pop me a note. :)

If I'm not hosting you, then you may be hosting me! I love to travel!

What am I like as a house guest?  

Well...  I keep spaces clean and tidy. Usually sleep at 10:30pm or 11pm. I wake up around 7am and I work remotely from 8:30am to 6pm Pacific time for my employer. I often work remotely while traveling. 

I don't smoke. I don't own pets.  I'm a digital marketer by trade. Originally, I am from Berkeley, CA.

I love being active and outside - Surfing, biking, hiking and skiing are some of my favorite things to do.  A perfect day would be a bike ride in the morning, a sail at sunset, and then, in the evening, dinner and live music with close friends.  Always looking for the next big adventure / challenge with a stay 'in the moment' perspective! (Website hidden by Airbnb)

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

As a host in my hometown of Oakland, CA, I am excited to be able to provide a place to stay for guests to explore everything my city and the Bay Area has to offer.

Thanks for checking out my space. A little about me, I'm a native Houstonian that moved to the Bay Area six years ago to study at UC Berkeley. I've always used Airbnb when traveling so it's been quite an adventure creating my own listings. I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and make some lasting friendships.

My friend Eric and I banded together to purchase our home here in Berkeley last year and are using Airbnb to help afford the mortgage while we make improvements to the property. We both also have full-time jobs and work from home so we'll for sure get a chance to talk.

Look forward to meeting you!

Nate

Need a car too? Check out my car rental options on Turo! Airbnb doesn't allow links to be shared in profiles but just message me or search the area on Turo, if I have a car available I'll beat any other comparable (model, year) and confirmed rental price!",within an hour,100%,84%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-30371408/original/2de81028-a5aa-446f-b06e-1ead060a845e.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-30371408/original/2de81028-a5aa-446f-b06e-1ead060a845e.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South Berkeley,7,9,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Berkeley, California, United States",Paradise Park,,37.84706,-122.27845,Private room in home,Private room,2,,3 shared baths,,1,[],$55.00,2,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,t,14,44,74,349,2023-12-20,16,16,0,2023-04-15,2023-10-25,4.94,5.0,4.88,4.81,5.0,4.5,4.81,,f,2,0,2,0,1.92

Thanks for checking out my space. A little about me, I'm a native Houstonian that moved to the Bay Area six years ago to study at UC Berkeley. I've always used Airbnb when traveling so it's been quite an adventure creating my own listings. I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and make some lasting friendships.

My friend Eric and I banded together to purchase our home here in Berkeley last year and are using Airbnb to help afford the mortgage while we make improvements to the property. We both also have full-time jobs and work from home so we'll for sure get a chance to talk.

Look forward to meeting you!

Nate

I am a father of two beautiful children living outside San Francisco, CA. My strong passion for travel has taken me all over the world. I get inspired by being exposed to different cultures and ways of life for inspiration. I lived in Japan for some time before moving back to the US.
 
Through the Airbnb hosting endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations! Nothing is more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.

I have now built a team, feel free to book or message me first; My team is friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.
 
I am a well-traveled guest who knows what hosts should do to create a comfortable experience. My goal is to fulfill these requirements for every guest.
 
Hope to host you soon!

I am a father of two beautiful children living outside San Francisco, CA. My strong passion for travel has taken me all over the world. I get inspired by being exposed to different cultures and ways of life for inspiration. I lived in Japan for some time before moving back to the US.
 
Through the Airbnb hosting endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations! Nothing is more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.

I have now built a team, feel free to book or message me first; My team is friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.
 
I am a well-traveled guest who knows what hosts should do to create a comfortable experience. My goal is to fulfill these requirements for every guest.
 
Hope to host you soon!
